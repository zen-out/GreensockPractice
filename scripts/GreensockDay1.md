Scalable Vector Graphics is an XML file that allows you to describe shapes, lines and text. You can create SVG images by using Adobe Illustrator or Sketch, which you can then manipulate to accordingly. 

You can create CSS animations by either creating a keyframes, 

@keyframes .className {
	0% {
	} 
	50% {
	}
	100% {
	} 
} 

You can also decide to utilize the animation css key and value pairs, such as 
- animation-duration
- animation-delay
- animation-iteration-count
- animation-direction
- animation-timing-function 
- animation-fill-mode
